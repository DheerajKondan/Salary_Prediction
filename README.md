# Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting salaries for various job roles using machine learning models. The dataset includes several job-related features like job title, salary estimates, job description, and company details. The goal is to build a model that predicts salary based on the provided features.

## Project Overview
The Salary Prediction project involves multiple steps of a data science and machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and performance evaluation.

### Key Components:
1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**  
   Libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, and `plotly` are used for data manipulation, statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning model development.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values in features like `min_salary`, `max_salary`, and `avg_salary`.
   - Convert categorical features (e.g., `Job Title`, `Company Name`, `Location`) into numerical representations using techniques like label encoding and one-hot encoding.
   - Create new features such as `avg_salary` from `min_salary` and `max_salary`, and extract useful information from textual data (e.g., whether the job requires Python, R, AWS skills).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize relationships between features such as job location, company rating, and salary.
   - Understand the distribution of `Salary Estimate` and identify patterns in job titles, industries, and sectors.
   - Analyze correlations between features like company age, location, and the presence of technologies such as Python, AWS, and Excel.

4. **Model Selection and Training**  
   Multiple machine learning models are implemented to predict salaries, including:
   - **Linear Regression**
   - **Random Forest Regressor**
   - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

   These models are trained using various evaluation techniques and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score.
   - Compare the performance of different models to select the best-performing one.
   - Visualize model predictions and residuals using `plotly` for enhanced interpretation.

6. **Visualization**  
   Use libraries like `plotly` and `seaborn` to create interactive visualizations for:
   - Salary distribution by job title, location, and industry.
   - Correlation heatmaps to identify the most important features influencing salary predictions.
   - Model performance metrics and error distribution.
